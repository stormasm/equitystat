More information can be garnered when there is a confirmation of the stock price crossing the 200 day moving average with a direction of UP and then the stock crossing the 50 day Moving Average with a direction of UP. The same conclusion is true in the opposite direction.";

The data from the first table is repeated in the second table for clarification and continuity purposes.";
