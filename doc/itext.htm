iText Reporting Tool

Before trying to dive into understanding iText
you should go to the 
<a href="http://www.lowagie.com/iText">iText</a>
web site and review
the documention provided with the distribution.  I would
even recommend downloading a copy of iText
and running through some of the demos.
<p>
For those of you who are Java programmers and want to
start working with iText the most important
document to read on the iText web site is the <b>Tutorial.</b>
This outlines in much detail the different objects and their
attributes for each type of element found in a report or document. 
<p>
All of the main iText reports for the Zrato system are
found in the packages starting with com.arcadian.itext.*.
<p>
There are 3 classes of reports generated in Zrato.
<ul>
<li>Algorithmic reports namely Moving Average</li>
<li>Sector / Industry Reports Based on Market Capitalizations</li>
<li>Future (EPS) Earnings Per Share Reports</li>
</ul>
<p>
The report names correlate with the following types of reports
<ul>
<li>EpsTechg00.pdf -- Earnings Per Share Report for the Technology Sector</li>
<li>Techg00.pdf -- Technology Sector Report</li>
<li>Matechg00.pdf -- Moving Average Report for the Technology Sector</li>
</ul>
<p>
To generate out all of the reports at once use <b>ant ga</b>.
<p>
This is a good starting point for understanding what iText can
do for you in concert with a Relational Database.
