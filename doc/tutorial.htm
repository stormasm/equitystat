<h1>
Zrato Tutorial
</h1>

<p>
Last modified on Wednesday June 29, 2005
</p>

<p>
Before running the programs in this tutorial be
sure you have read the 
<a href=./installwindows.htm>installation</a> document.
Assuming Zrato is properly installed and the simple test
at the end of the installation document has run successfully,
then you are now ready to run the tutorial.
</p>
<p>
It is also important to note that the data in the zrato database is only
a sample for a particular industry group.  Depending on your trading
strategies and scenario, the database has to be populated on a regular
basis with up to date financial information.  Please contact us to
find out what the best strategy is for your company for accessing
fresh data. We provide consulting services on how to parse
a data feed and store the information in the database.
<p>
Zrato can be broken down to 3 simple steps.
<ul>
<li>1. Populate the database</li>
<li>2. Run your trading algorithms</li>
<li>3. View the output or results</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this tutorial, step 1 is already taken care of for you.  By
installing the zrato database in your MySql server you have
populated your database with a sample set of data.  In the future,
you will need to populate your database with a specified set of
companies that you are interested in following.  This set of companies
can also be based on an index or an industry group or both.
<p>
For now, we will assume that your database is populated.
<p>
The next step is to run your trading algorithms.  We have
designed a 200 day Moving Average calculation.  This algorithm calculates
the average of the past 200 days of trading for each company in the
database each day over the total period of time in the hp 
(historical price) table.  It then looks at the 200 day moving average
on a particular day along with the closing price on that day
and determines if the price has crossed over the 200 day moving
average.  If it has, it then logs the date 
in the <b>ma</b> table
in which the cross over
occurred along with the direction in which it crossed the average.
In a bullish scenario, the price crosses the 200 day moving average
in an upward direction and so <b>up</b> is logged.  In a bearish
scenario, the price on a particular day crosses the 200 day moving
average in a downward direction and so <b>down</b> is logged.  If
nothing happened on that day, in other words no crossing occurred
then nothing is logged.  It is now time to run this algorithm and
then review the ma table to see what your data looks like.

<p>
<h3>
Tutorial Step One, calculate the moving averages and populate the ma table
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
ant ma
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The final step is to review the output of the results of running your
trading algorithm.  Zrato does this by generating a report based on
<a href="http://www.lowagie.com/itext">iText</a>
a powerful open source Java reporting tool that has the ability to
deliver rich content onto the screen via PDF.

The reporting engine is now ready to generate out a PDF report.


<h3>
Tutorial Step Two, build the moving average report.
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
ant gm
</li>
</ul>
</p>

The PDF report will end up located on your disk in the directory
where you installed the Zrato product.  If you look
in that directory, you should see
the file <b>Matechg00.pdf</b>


<p>
Take a look at the <b>Matechg00.pdf</b> report and note how the
companies whose 50 and 200 day Moving averages have UP directions
have been in a bullish trading pattern for
quite some time.  This means that on that particular day a bullish
signal occurred, and the closing price crossed the 200 day moving
average upward and its stayed above the moving average 
delineating the fact that the underlying fundamentals of this
company are improving thus driving the stock price higher and higher
over time.  To confirm this, go to your favorite website with stock
charts and look at several things.  First of all look at the charts
of these companies. Note, that for the past
year their stock has been going up, you can also plot the stock price
versus the 200 day moving average on many popular financial web sites.
<p>
The initial aspects of the Tutorial have now been covered.
We have completed all three core steps:
<p>
<ul>
<li>1. Populate the database</li>
<li>2. Run your trading algorithms</li>
<li>3. View the output or results</li>
</ul>

<p>
At this point in time, you are ready to start writing your own
trading algorithms and viewing the output by generating reports.
It is nice, however, to take a look at a couple of other reports
and data to get more of a feel of what Zrato can do for you.
<p>
Before you do that, be sure you have reviewed the 
<a href=./database.htm>Database</a>
document.  This outlines the database schema and the information
that is found in each database table.
<p>
We are going to generate tables based on two other data sets
that come with the Zrato database.  
<p>
Reviewing the set of reports will give you some insight into
the different industries in the technology sector.
