<strong>About Us</strong>
<p>
<p>
The Zrato team is a small group of equity analysts and java programmers.  We have
been in the business of designing automated trading systems for 15 years.  Our
successful track record in trading the financial markets has allowed us the freedom
to design a system based on over 33 years of investment experience.  We placed
our first trade in 1971, and are still as passionate now as we were then about the
complexity and fascination of the market.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is to help you better understand what is going on in the equity markets
by coming up with algorithms that sorts through data on thousands of companies
and reduces it down to investment opportunities that are tailored to your way
of thinking about the markets.
